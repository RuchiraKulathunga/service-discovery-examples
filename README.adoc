= Vert.x Circuit Breaker examples

Here you will find examples demonstrating Vert.x Circuit Breaker.

Vert.x Circuit Breaker is an implementation of the Circuit Breaker _pattern_ for Vert.x.

It keeps track of the
number of failures and _open the circuit_ when a threshold is reached. Optionally, a fallback is executed.

Supported failures are:

* failures reported by your code
* exception thrown by your code
* uncompleted futures (timeout)

Operations guarded by a circuit breaker are intended to by non-blocking and asynchronous in order to benefits from
the Vert.x execution model.

To use the circuit breaker you need to:

* Create a circuit breaker, with the configuration you want (timeout, number of failure before opening the circuit)

* Execute some code using the breaker

== Client example

* Creates a circuit breaker which
  can fail 5 times before opening the circuit
  consider a failure if the operation does not succeed in time
  time spent in open state before attempting to re-try is 5 seconds

* The execute method sends a request to localhost at port 8080

* The fallback is called whenever the circuit is open

You can run the Client file by vertx commandline tools or by the main method if you are using an IDE.
If you run the example without running any server, the execution will fail due to timeout.
